John: Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's meeting about the Q3 marketing strategy.

Sarah: Thanks John. I've prepared the analytics from our last campaign that I'd like to share.

John: Great. Before we dive into the data, I wanted to remind everyone about our goals for this quarter.

Michael: Speaking of goals, are we still focusing on expanding our social media presence?

Sarah: Yes, the data shows our engagement has increased by 24% on Instagram and LinkedIn.

John: That's impressive. I think we should allocate more resources to those channels.

Michael: Agreed. We should also consider bringing on that influencer partnership we discussed last month.

John: Good point. Sarah, can you put together a proposal for that by next Friday?

Sarah: Yes, I'll have that ready by then.

John: Perfect. Let's move on to the budget discussion...`;
