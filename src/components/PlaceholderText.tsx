  return `Bob: Hey everyone, thanks for joining today's product planning meeting. Um, so we've got quite a bit to cover.

Alice: Yeah, I'm excited to, like, get moving on this new feature set. The customers have been asking for this for a while.

Bob: Definitely. So the main goal today is to finalize the Q3 roadmap and, you know, make sure we all understand our priorities.

Carlos: Can I just ask - are we still planning to release the mobile app update before the desktop version?

Bob: Good question. After talking with the dev team, we've decided to push the mobile update to Q4. You know, there are just too many bugs to fix first.

Alice: That makes sense. So our first priority is fixing the login issues on the desktop app, right?

Bob: Correct. Sarah, you're going to lead that project. Can you have it done by June 15th?

Sarah: Yes, I can commit to that deadline. I'll need some help from Michael's team though.

Michael: We can support that. My team will allocate 20 hours per week to this project.

Bob: Great. Next item - the new onboarding flow. Carlos, this is your baby. Where are we with that?

Carlos: I've completed the wireframes. I need approval on the final design by Friday if we want to hit our July 1 release date.

Alice: I'll review those tomorrow morning and get you feedback by end of day.

Bob: Perfect. Now, about the budget increase we requested...

Alice: I spoke with finance yesterday. They've approved the 15% increase we asked for.

Bob: That's excellent news! That means we can bring on that additional developer we've been talking about.

Michael: Should we discuss the open questions about the API integration with the payment processor?

Bob: Let's table that for now. We need more information from the vendor. I'll schedule a call with them for next week.

Sarah: One last thing - are we still planning to use the new project management tool?

Bob: Yes, we've decided to move forward with Monday.com. IT will set everyone up by the end of the week.

Alice: I think we've covered everything. This was a really productive meeting everyone!`;
